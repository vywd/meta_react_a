+A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page. 

+A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio.

+A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion

+A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+Did the header have external links that take you to different social apps? 

+Did the header have internal links that, when clicked, will smoothly scroll into their corresponding section? 

+Was the landing section filled with an avatar, name and a short bio? 

+Did the project section display a 2x2 grid with each project rendered in a card widget? 

=-Was the Contact Me form business logic implemented as per the requirements? 

+Was the header hidden/shown depending on the scroll direction? Did it happen with a smooth transition animation? 

Can you suggest any improvements for the portfolio app?
