+A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page. 

A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio.

A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion

A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the header have external links that take you to different social apps? 

Did the header have internal links that, when clicked, will smoothly scroll into their corresponding section? 

Was the landing section filled with an avatar, name and a short bio? 

Did the project section display a 2x2 grid with each project rendered in a card widget? 

Was the Contact Me form business logic implemented as per the requirements? 

Was the header hidden/shown depending on the scroll direction? Did it happen with a smooth transition animation? 

Can you suggest any improvements for the portfolio app?
